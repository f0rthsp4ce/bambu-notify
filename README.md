## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **BambUI** - Required backend service that connects to your printers
2. **Bambu printer** with network connectivity (P1S, P1P, A1, A1M)
3. **Telegram account** for notifications
4. **Python 3.8+** or **Docker**

### 0. Set up BambUI (Required)

**Bambu Notify requires [BambUI](https://github.com/fidoriel/BambUI) as its backend service.** BambUI handles the direct connection to your Bambu printers and provides the API/WebSocket endpoints that Bambu Notify connects to.

**Install BambUI first:**

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended)
# Create bambui.yml file:
cat > bambui.yml << EOF
services:
  bambui:
    image: ghcr.io/fidoriel/bambui:edge
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - BAMBUI_PRINTER.MY-P1S.IP=192.168.1.100  # Your printer IP
      - BAMBUI_PRINTER.MY-P1S.ACCESS_CODE=12345678  # Your access code
      - BAMBUI_PRINTER.MY-P1S.SERIAL=01P00C12345678  # Your printer serial
      - BAMBUI_PRINTER.MY-P1S.MODEL=P1S  # P1S, P1P, A1, or A1M
EOF

# Start BambUI
docker compose -f bambui.yml up -d
```

**Verify BambUI is working:**
- Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
- You should see your printer dashboard
- API should be available at http://localhost:8080/api/printers

**Configure Bambu Notify to use BambUI:**
```bash
export PRINTERS_API_URL="http://localhost:8080/api/printers"
export WS_URL_TEMPLATE="ws://localhost:8080/ws/printer/{printer_id}"
```

For more details on BambUI setup, see the [BambUI documentation](https://github.com/fidoriel/BambUI).

## 📊 Monitoring & Dashboards

### Prometheus Metrics

Bambu Notify exports comprehensive metrics for monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

**Key Metrics:**
- `bambu_printer_up{printer_id}` - Printer online status
- `bambu_printer_is_active{printer_id}` - Active print detection
- `bambu_progress_percent{printer_id}` - Print progress percentage
- `bambu_remaining_time_minutes{printer_id}` - Estimated time remaining
- `bambu_nozzle_temperature_celsius{printer_id}` - Current nozzle temperature
- `bambu_bed_temperature_celsius{printer_id}` - Current bed temperature
- And many more...

**Prometheus Configuration:**
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: bambu_notify
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:8000"]
    scrape_interval: 30s
```

### Grafana Dashboard

A pre-built Grafana dashboard is included (`dashboard.json`) with:
- 📈 Real-time progress tracking
- 🌡️ Temperature monitoring (nozzle, bed, chamber)
- 🖥️ System health metrics
- 📊 Print statistics and history
- 🏃 Speed and fan monitoring

**To import the dashboard:**
1. Open Grafana → Dashboards → Import
2. Upload `dashboard.json` from this repository
3. Select your Prometheus data source
4. Enjoy your new monitoring dashboard!

## 🎥 Advanced Features

### Automatic Timelapse Creation

Bambu Notify automatically creates timelapse videos when prints complete:

- **Automatic capture:** Photos are saved during active prints
- **Smart compilation:** Uses ffmpeg to create smooth timelapses 
- **Size optimization:** Videos are kept under 50MB for easy sharing
- **Telegram delivery:** Completed timelapses are automatically sent to your chat

**How it works:**
1. During printing, snapshots are saved to `images/{printer_id}/{job_name}/`
2. When the print finishes, ffmpeg compiles all frames into an MP4
3. The timelapse is automatically sent to your Telegram chat
4. Original frames are retained for 7 days (configurable)

### Manual Timelapse Creation

Want to create custom timelapses? You can use the saved frames directly:

```bash
# Navigate to your job's image folder
cd "images/A1M-1/my_awesome_print"

# Create a 30-second timelapse at 30 FPS
ffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpg' \
  -vf "scale=1280:-2" -r 30 -t 30 \
  -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  my_custom_timelapse.mp4
```

### AI Failure Detection

Enable intelligent print monitoring with AI-powered defect detection:

**Setup:**
1. Get an API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your environment
3. Bambu Notify will automatically analyze frames every hour

**What it detects:**
- 🍝 Spaghetti failures
- 📐 Layer shifts and misalignments  
- 🔗 Adhesion problems
- 💥 Nozzle crashes
- 🔄 Severe stringing

**Smart alerts:**
- Only triggers on high-confidence detections
- Sends evidence photos along with alerts
- Mentions you directly for urgent issues
- Ignores camera blur/focus issues

**Supported Models:**
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (default, fast and accurate)
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` (highly accurate)
- `openai/gpt-4o` (reliable detection)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No notifications received:**
1. Verify your bot token and chat ID are correct
2. Ensure the bot has permission to post in your chat/group
3. Check if the bot is actually added to the correct chat
4. Look at the application logs for error messages

**Printer not detected:**
1. **Check BambUI first:** Ensure BambUI is running and accessible at your configured URL
2. Verify BambUI can see your printer: Visit http://localhost:8080 
3. Test the BambUI API directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/printers`
4. Verify your `PRINTERS_API_URL` and `WS_URL_TEMPLATE` settings
5. Check if your printer is on the same network as BambUI
6. Try the debug endpoint: `/api/debug/state`

**Timelapse not created:**
1. Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed and accessible
2. Check if there are enough frames saved (minimum 2 required)
3. Verify disk space for saving videos
4. Look for ffmpeg error messages in logs

**AI detection not working:**
1. Verify your OpenRouter API key is valid and has credits
2. Check the AI model is supported and available
3. Ensure internet connectivity for API calls
4. Verify the confidence threshold isn't set too high

### Debug Endpoints

Use these endpoints to diagnose issues:

```bash
# Check overall system state
curl http://localhost:8000/api/debug/state | jq

# Force an immediate status update
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/debug/force-seed
```

### Logs and Monitoring

**View application logs:**
```bash
# For Docker
docker logs bambu-notify

# For Python installation  
python app.py  # logs will show in terminal
```

**Health check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/
# Should return "OK"
```

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Security
- Keep your bot token secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider using environment files or container secrets for sensitive data
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx/traefik) with TLS for production deployments

### Performance
- The application stores only the latest status and image in memory
- Historical data is available through Prometheus metrics
- Images are automatically cleaned up after the retention period
- Consider adjusting notification frequency for high-traffic setups

### Multi-Printer Setup
- Printers are automatically discovered from the configured API endpoint
- Each printer gets its own WebSocket connection and state tracking
- All notifications include the printer ID for easy identification
- Use Grafana dashboard variables to filter by specific printers

### Backup and Recovery
- Important data is stored in the `images/` directory
- Prometheus metrics can be backed up if historical data is needed
- Configuration is entirely through environment variables
